<h1="text-capitalize">VISUAL STUDIO CODE & Console Screen</h1>
<p1>visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.
 First and foremost, it is an editor that gets out of your way. The delightfully frictionless edit-build-debug cycle means less time fiddling with your environment, and more time executing on your ideas.
Available for macOS, Linux, and Windows</p1>
<p2>Web developers often log messages to the Console to make sure that their JavaScript is working as expected. 
To log a message, you insert an expression like console.log('Hello, Console!') into your JavaScript. 
When the browser executes your JavaScript and sees an expression like that, it knows that it's supposed to log the message to the Console.
Web developers log messages for 2 general reasons:
Making sure that code is executing in the right order.
Inspecting the values of variables at a certain moment in time.
The Console is also a REPL. You can run JavaScript in the Console to interact with the page that you're inspecting.
